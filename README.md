# makeDemo

This demo was copied from <https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/>.

You can check out the code located in the three files (hellomake.c, hellofunc.c, and hellomake.h and read the Makefile) to understand what is going on... or you can not. 

To get this to work, all you have to do is follow the instructions. 

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/hoppersroppers/makeDemo.git
2. cd into the directory
3. Run the command "make"

Because I'm the worst, this 'make' command will fail. Look through the different files in the source code and figure out what is broken, and fix it. 

4. Run "make" again!

The executable 'hellomake' will have been built. Execute it like any normal file, using './hellomake'. 

5. Commit and push your changes so that I can see how you modified the code.

Congratulations on building a program from source. I can't guarantee fixing problems will be this easy, but here's hoping!
